# Streaming Thoughts
An audio journaling app with cloud storage and user accounts.

## Installation/Requirements
Requirements:
- Android Device running Android 11 (optional)
- Android Studio

Installation:
1. Open the StreamingThoughts folder on Android Studio
2. Select either a real device running Android 11 or emulated device running 11
3. Press Run to install and run the application

## Some Implementation Details
The storage was done using Firebase Storage. When the user is first presented the 
app, they have the choice to either just start using the application or sign in to
a preexisting account. Now, since this is pretty clunky, this issue is currently
being addressed. 

## Development Details
Initial bulk working period: June 2020 - July 2020

## Work in Progress 
- Create an apk for easy install
- Overhauling UI elements
- Unifying UI color scheme
- Redo sign in flow for better user experience
